    "# Destination City\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "You are given an array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityA_i, cityB_i]` represents a direct path going from `cityA_i` to `cityB_i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **destination city** — the city with **no outgoing paths**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed the graph of paths forms a **single line** (no loops), so there is exactly one destination city.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "**Example 1**\n",
    "Input: paths = [[\"London\",\"New York\"],[\"New York\",\"Lima\"],[\"Lima\",\"Sao Paulo\"]]\n",
    "Output: \"Sao Paulo\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2**\n",
    "Input: paths = [[\"B\",\"C\"],[\"D\",\"B\"],[\"C\",\"A\"]]\n",
    "Output: \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3**\n",
    "Input: paths = [[\"A\",\"Z\"]]\n",
    "Output: \"Z\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "- `1 <= paths.length <= 100`\n",
    "- `paths[i].length == 2`\n",
    "- `1 <= len(cityA_i), len(cityB_i) <= 10`\n",
    "- `cityA_i != cityB_i`\n",
    "- Cities are strings of English letters and spaces.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** In a line-shaped path, every “middle” city appears once as a start and once as an end.\n",
    "The **final destination** appears **only as an end** (never as a start).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Build a set `starts` containing all starting cities (`cityA` from each pair).\n",
    "2. Scan the paths again: the answer is the first `cityB` that is **not** in `starts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because the destination has **no outgoing edge**, so it never shows up among starting cities.\n"
