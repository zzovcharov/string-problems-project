    "The problem asks for the **largest string `x`** such that both `str1` and `str2` can be formed by repeating `x` one or more times.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this like finding the **“string GCD”**, just as we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If both strings are made of the same repeating unit, then:\n",
    "str1 + str2 == str2 + str1\n",
    "\n",
    "This property guarantees that both strings have the same \"building block\" pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once that is true, the largest possible divisor string will have a length equal to the **GCD of their lengths**:\n",
    "k = gcd(len(str1), len(str2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Because only a substring of this length can evenly divide both strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The final answer is the **prefix of str1** up to that length:\n",

    "> Now, the size of their shared building block must evenly divide both string lengths.\n",
