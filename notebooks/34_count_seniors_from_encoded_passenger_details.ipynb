    "# ️ Count Seniors from Encoded Passenger Details\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `details`.\n",
    "Each `details[i]` is a string of length **15** that encodes information about a passenger:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Characters `0` to `9` (10 chars): phone number\n",
    "- Character `10`: gender (`'M'`, `'F'`, or `'O'`)\n",
    "- Characters `11` and `12`: age of the person (2-digit number)\n",
    "- Characters `13` and `14`: seat number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "Return the number of passengers who are **strictly more than 60 years old**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Input:  details = [\"7868190130M7522\",\"5303914400F9211\",\"9273338290F4010\"]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- \"7868190130M7522\" → age = 75\n",
    "- \"5303914400F9211\" → age = 92\n",
    "- \"9273338290F4010\" → age = 40\n",
    "Passengers 0 and 1 are over 60 → answer = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Input:  details = [\"1313579440F2036\",\"2921522980M5644\"]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Ages are 20 and 56 → nobody over 60.\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= details.length <= 100\n",
    "\n",
    "details[i].length == 15\n",
    "\n",
    "details[i] consists of digits '0'–'9' except at index 10 (gender).\n",
    "\n",
    "details[i][10] is 'M', 'F', or 'O'.\n",

    "1. We iterate through each encoded string in `details`.\n",
    "2. For each `info` string:\n",
    "   - Extract the **age substring**: `info[11:13]`\n",
    "     - Because:\n",
    "       - Index 10 = gender\n",
    "       - Index 11–12 = age (2 characters)\n",
    "   - Convert it to an integer with `int(info[11:13])`.\n",
    "3. If the age is **greater than 60**, we increment a counter.\n",
    "4. Return the counter at the end.\n",

    "We don’t care about phone number, gender, or seat for this problem —\n",
