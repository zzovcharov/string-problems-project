    "A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] can be represented as a string s of length n where:\n",
    "\n",
    "s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and\n",
    "s[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].\n",
    "Given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return the lexicographically smallest permutation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",

    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem gives a string `s` consisting of `'I'` and `'D'`, and asks for a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n]` (where `n = len(s)`) such that:\n",
    "- `'I'` → the next number is **greater** than the current.\n",
    "- `'D'` → the next number is **smaller** than the current.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the **lexicographically smallest** permutation, we start with the smallest increasing list:\n",
    "[0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we process the string:\n",
    "- For every **continuous run of `'D'`**, reverse the corresponding segment of numbers in the list.\n",
    "- Leave `'I'` segments unchanged (they already satisfy the condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because reversing a `'D'` run minimally enforces the \"decreasing\" pattern without disturbing the rest of the sequence, keeping the permutation as small as possible.\n"
