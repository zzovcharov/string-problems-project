    "# Maximum Odd Binary Number\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a **binary string** `s` that contains **at least one '1'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **rearrange its bits** to create the **maximum possible odd binary number**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary number is **odd** if and only if **its last bit is 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may rearrange the bits in any order.\n",
    "Leading zeros are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the resulting maximum odd binary number as a **string**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "Input: s = \"010\"\n",
    "Output: \"001\"\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Only one '1', so it must go at the last position.\n",
    "Remaining bits = \"00\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "Input: s = \"0101\"\n",
    "Output: \"1001\"\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "One '1' must be the last digit. Remaining bits should form the maximum binary number = \"100\".\n",
    "Answer = \"100\" + \"1\".\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the string in descending order**\n",
    "   This places all `'1'`s first, then `'0'`s — the largest possible binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. However, the **last bit MUST be '1'** to make the number odd.\n",
    "   But after sorting descending, the last bit becomes `'0'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. So we:\n",
    "   - Scan from **right to left**\n",
    "   - Find the **rightmost '1'**\n",
    "   - Swap it with the **last character**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now the final string:\n",
    "   - starts with as many `'1'`s as possible (making it large)\n",
    "   - ends with `'1'` (ensuring it's odd)\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the **maximum odd binary number**.\n"

    "> “First, I want the number to be as big as possible, so I put all the `'1'`s in front and all the `'0'`s after — sorting in reverse order does that.\n",
