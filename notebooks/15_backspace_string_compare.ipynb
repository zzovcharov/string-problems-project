    "# Backspace String Compare\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given two strings `s` and `t`.\n",
    "Each string represents what was typed into an empty text editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The special character `'#'` means \"backspace\" — it deletes the previous character, if there is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing rules:\n",
    "- Typing a normal letter adds it to the text.\n",
    "- Typing `'#'` removes the most recently added letter.\n",
    "- If the text is already empty and you press `'#'`, it stays empty (no error, just nothing happens).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Process both strings `s` and `t` according to those typing rules, and then check:\n",
    "Do they end up producing the **same final text**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Return:\n",
    "- `True` if yes\n",
    "- `False` if no\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**\n",
    "`s = \"ab#c\"`\n",
    "`t = \"ad#c\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing `s`:\n",
    "- `\"a\"` → `\"ab\"` → backspace removes `\"b\"` → `\"a\"` → `\"ac\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing `t`:\n",
    "- `\"a\"` → `\"ad\"` → backspace removes `\"d\"` → `\"a\"` → `\"ac\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Both become `\"ac\"`, so the answer is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2**\n",
    "`s = \"a#c\"`\n",
    "`t = \"b\"`\n",
    "`s` becomes `\"c\"`, `t` becomes `\"b\"`, so the answer is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Implement a function `backspaceCompare(s, t)` that returns `True` or `False`.\n"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate typing using a stack-like list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea:\n",
    "- We read the string left to right.\n",
    "- We keep a list called `stack` that represents the current text in the editor.\n",
    "- For each character:\n",
    "  - If it's a normal character (not `'#'`), we append it to the list.\n",
    "  - If it's `'#'`, we remove (\"pop\") the last character from the list, but only if the list is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we finish processing, the list contains the final text that would remain on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this for both `s` and `t`, and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this works:\n",
    "- The list is behaving like the text box.\n",
    "- Appending is like typing.\n",
    "- Popping is like pressing backspace.\n",
    "- Ignoring backspace when the list is empty matches the rule \"backspacing empty text keeps it empty.\"\n"

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're the text box.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now someone types characters from the string, one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If they type `'a'`, you say: \"Okay, I'll remember `'a'`.\"\n",
    "- If they type `'b'`, you say: \"Now I have `'a'` and `'b'`.\"\n",
    "- If they type `'#'`, they are telling you: \"Forget the last thing you remembered.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "- `'abc#d'` works like:\n",
    "  - type `'a'` → \"a\"\n",
    "  - type `'b'` → \"ab\"\n",
    "  - type `'c'` → \"abc\"\n",
    "  - type `'#'` → remove last (remove `'c'`) → now \"ab\"\n",
    "  - type `'d'` → \"abd\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, your memory is `\"abd\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now do that for both strings `s` and `t`.\n",
    "If what you remember at the end is the same, return `True`.\n",
    "Otherwise return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say it:\n",
    "We are not comparing `s` and `t` directly.\n",
    "We are comparing **their final effect** after simulating typing with backspaces.\n"

    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `n` be the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process one string:\n",
    "- We look at each character once.\n",
    "- For each character, we either:\n",
    "  - append to a list, or\n",
    "  - pop from that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `append` and `pop` from the end of a Python list are O(1) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So processing a string is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "We process `s` and `t` separately.\n",
    "That is O(n) + O(m), where `n = len(s)` and `m = len(t)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall time: **O(n + m)**\n",
    "Space: **O(n + m)** in the worst case (if there are no `'#'`, we store all characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How we justify it's O(n) and not O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there's logic inside a loop, we never redo work on the same character.\n",
    "Each character is handled once and either added or removed once.\n",
    "That's linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure complexity by counting total character operations, not just “how many loops we wrote.”\n",
    "\n",

    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text editor undo/backspace simulation\n",
    "   This is literally what your keyboard does in a chat box, or what messaging apps do before you hit \"send.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Processing log corrections\n",
    "   Suppose you get a stream of events like:\n",
    "   `\"A A A BACKSPACE A BACKSPACE BACKSPACE B\"`\n",
    "   You want the final \"true\" state after fixes. That's exactly this logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling typos in commands\n",
    "   Think of a CLI where `#` is a \"delete previous char.\"\n",
    "   You might need to interpret what the user actually intended to type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern is \"apply edits to a sequence and compute the final committed form.\"\n"
